##  Key Lessons Learned about Clean Code

- **Use meaningful names**: Choosing descriptive variable, class, and function names improves readability and maintainability.
- **Keep functions short and focused**: A good function should do one thing only and do it well.
- **Follow the DRY principle**: Avoid code duplication by using functions and keeping logic reusable.

## Weekly Content Example

Each week's work is placed in a folder such as `prac_01`, `prac_02`, etc.  
You will find Python code, data files, and README files inside each folder.

All coding tasks are version controlled using Git with **branches**, **pull requests**, and **code reviews**.
